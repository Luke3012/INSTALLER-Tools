# INSTALLER Tools

INSTALLER Tools is a lightweight utility designed to back up a computer’s user folder quickly and efficiently.  
It automatically detects if **OneDrive** is in use and prompts the user to choose which folder to copy, making it a valuable tool for preparing a system before formatting.

This program was originally intended as a configuration interface for **INSTALLER** back when it was not yet a self-contained system — the name reflects that origin.

## Features

- **Quick User Folder Backup:** Copy important user data before system formatting.
- **OneDrive Detection:** Detects if the system is using OneDrive and lets the user choose the folder to copy.
- **Detailed File View:** Displays a list of files already copied and those pending.
- **Progress & Status Display:** Shows the current copy status in real time.
- **Per-Folder Size Information:** Displays the space used by each folder.
- **Skipped Items List:** Identifies files or folders that could not be copied.
- **Restore Function:** Allows restoration of the backed-up user folder.
- **Streamlined Workflow:** Simplifies the backup and restoration process for faster PC servicing.
- **Portable Tool:** No installation required.

## How It Was Used

When working in a tech shop, INSTALLER Tools was used to:
1. Detect the user’s main data folder (local or OneDrive).
2. Display detailed file lists, folder sizes, and skip reports.
3. Copy the data to a secure location (USB drive, external disk).
4. Restore the user’s folder if needed after formatting.

## Requirements

- Windows operating system.
- Access permissions to the user folder and backup location.

## Status

Still functional for manual backup and restore purposes, though no longer actively used in modern workflows.

## License

Provided for archival and historical purposes.
